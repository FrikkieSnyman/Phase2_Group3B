	\textbf{Database: } \\
	In the scope of the BUZZ system and taking into consideration the type of data the system should store, we have concluded to make use of a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). The BUZZ system will store only structured data with strong relations between content (e.g. Threads and Social Tags). Persistence of data is also closely related to the auditibility of the BUZZ system, hence deleted threads will not be removed completely from the database, but instead be archived (marked as hidden) for possible later retrieval.
