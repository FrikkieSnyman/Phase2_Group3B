	%Still need to add some points when I think of them.
	\subsubsection{Scalability:} 
Scalability is of extreme importance.

No assumptions can be made on the strength and size of the servers that the BUZZ system will be hosted on and hence need to be scalable at any point in time. We also have to take into account that there will be a small margin of growth in users as the years go by since the University allows for this growth (an estimate of 10\%) in their student admission numbers.

	\subsubsection{Performance Requirements:} 
Performance is a very important requirement as the system must be able to accomodate thousands of users and threads.

The system will mostly be run on large servers capable of servicing an entire university, however performance must still be considered.

	\subsubsection{Maintainability:} 
Maintainability is very important to the system as any failure of a key component could result in loss of data or the inability to use the system.

	%Still need to edit my points at a later stage.
	\subsubsection{Reliability and Availability:} 
The reliability and availability of the system is important for all users, i.e. The students, tutors, lecturers, and administrative staff.

If the system is unavailable, then users would not be able to access the required information on the system. This could have serious implications on all users. It is thus imperative to minimise system downtime, thus maximising system availability.	
		
		\subsubsection{Security:} 
The security of the system is important for all users, i.e. The students, tutors, lecturers, and administrative staff.

The purpose of security is to protect the information stored in the system, whether it be the systems information or user data, and prevent unauthorised access to and/or modification of the information.
\newline
 
	\subsubsection{Monitorability and Auditability:} 
The system will be monitored by the administrative staff and users that are specifically assigned the role of maintenance. 

This will help ensure that users abide by the netiquette and plagiarism policies.

	\subsubsection{Testability:} 
		
	Testability is of medium importance in the system. The system needs to be tested before it goes online. 
		
		
	\subsubsection{Usability:} 
		
		User experience is an important aspect in the system. The users should be able to easily identify all the elements of the system as well as be able to use them with ease.
		

	\subsubsection{Integrability:} 
		
	Integrability is of medium importance. It will be used for security reasons and portability reasons.
